> tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals (or windows), each running a separate program, to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen. tmux may be detached from a screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached.

[Tmux][] is an awesome tool I couldn't live without on a computer ; it is GNU
screen on steroids !

This repository contains the tmux configuration and a collection of tools
around it. It aims to be used with [vcsh-home][] and [sh-config][] at least.
